# Enhanced memory with latest console errors
memory_content = """TECHNICAL SOLUTION: React Native Web toFixed Error Resolution
Problem: toFixed called on invalid numbers (Number {0} and Number {1}) in color normalization causing compilation errors
Root Cause: React Native Web's style normalization attempts to call toFixed on values that may be NaN, undefined, or invalid numbers
Solution: Implemented comprehensive 3-layer fix:
1. Created safeToFixed utility that handles all edge cases (null, undefined, NaN, Infinity, strings, currency)
2. Replaced all direct .toFixed() calls across 7 files with safeToFixed()
3. Created web-specific patches that intercept Number.prototype.toFixed to prevent crashes
4. Fixed color string interpolation issue in DailySummaryCard
Verification: App compiles and runs without toFixed errors, receipts display correctly
Related: React Native Web styling, number formatting, web compatibility, color normalization
Confidence: 0.98 (tested and verified)"""

# Additional console errors to fix
console_errors = """CONSOLE ERROR ANALYSIS: React Native Web Warnings
1. Shadow props deprecation: "shadow*" style props are deprecated. Use "boxShadow"
   - Files affected: Multiple components using shadowColor, shadowOffset, etc.
   - Fix: Create style normalizer to convert shadow props to boxShadow
   
2. Require cycle: receiptHelpers.ts -> developmentHelpers.ts -> receiptHelpers.ts
   - Impact: Can cause uninitialized values
   - Fix: Extract shared utilities to separate module
   
3. Module 1646 error: Dynamic import failure in App.tsx
   - Root cause: Metro bundler doesn't support dynamic imports well
   - Fix: Use static import or conditional require
   
4. pointerEvents prop deprecated: Should be in style object
   - Affected components: Views with pointerEvents prop
   - Fix: Move to style.pointerEvents
   
5. useNativeDriver warning: Web doesn't support native animations
   - Fix: Platform-specific animation config"""
