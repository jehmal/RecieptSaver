# Receipt Vault Pro UI/UX Specification

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for Receipt Vault Pro's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

- **Sarah, Small Business Owner:** Runs a 10-person marketing agency, needs quick expense tracking for tax deductions. Tech-comfortable but time-poor. Uses iPhone primarily, laptop for monthly reconciliation.
- **Mike, Field Sales Rep:** Constantly on the road, accumulates 20-30 receipts weekly. Needs instant capture without breaking stride. Android user, minimal patience for complex apps.
- **Elena, Office Manager:** Manages expenses for 5 employees, needs oversight and organization. Desktop-first user who reviews and categorizes receipts in batches.

### Usability Goals

- Ease of learning: New users can capture and save their first receipt within 30 seconds
- Efficiency of use: Receipt capture completed in under 10 seconds from app open
- Error prevention: Smart edge detection reduces failed captures by 90%
- Memorability: Core features accessible within 2 taps from any screen
- Satisfaction: Delightful micro-interactions make expense tracking feel less like a chore

### Design Principles

1. **Camera-First Architecture** - The camera is the hero feature, always one tap away
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Start simple, reveal complexity only when users need it
3. **Platform Native Feel** - Honor iOS/Android conventions while maintaining brand consistency
4. **Forgiving Interface** - Easy to undo, retry, or correct any action
5. **Accessible by Default** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance built into every component

## User Flows

### Camera Capture Flow

**User Goal:** Quickly capture a receipt with minimal friction

**Entry Points:** App launch (default), Camera tab, FAB on any screen

**Success Criteria:** Receipt captured, edges detected, image saved locally within 10 seconds

#### Flow Diagram

```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**

- Poor lighting: Show brightness adjustment slider
- Multiple receipts: Prompt to capture separately
- Blurry image: Shake animation with "Hold steady" message
- Storage full: Immediate warning with cleanup option

**Notes:** Auto-capture can be disabled in settings for users who prefer manual control

### Receipt Search Flow

**User Goal:** Find specific receipts quickly by date, amount, or merchant

**Entry Points:** Search tab, search icon in gallery, widget shortcut

**Success Criteria:** Target receipt found in under 3 taps/10 seconds

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    Start[Gallery/Home] --> Search[Tap Search]
    Search --> Input[Search Input Focused]
    Input --> Type{Search Type?}
    Type -->|Text| TextSearch[Type Merchant/Note]

## Responsiveness Strategy

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices        |
| :--------- | :-------- | :-------- | :-------------------- |
| Mobile     | 320px     | 767px     | Phones                |

| Wide       | 1440px    | -         | Large displays        |

### Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes:** 
- Mobile: Single column, bottom navigation
- Tablet: Two column with side navigation
- Desktop: Three column with enhanced detail view

**Navigation Changes:**
- Mobile: Bottom tabs
- Tablet: Side rail
- Desktop: Side rail + top bar

**Content Priority:**
- Mobile: Camera and recent receipts
- Tablet: Gallery with preview
- Desktop: Full dashboard view

**Interaction Changes:**
- Mobile: Touch-first, gestures
- Tablet: Touch + hover states
- Desktop: Mouse-first, keyboard shortcuts

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

1. **Purpose-driven**: Every animation has functional value
2. **Snappy**: 200-300ms for most transitions
3. **Natural**: Follow platform physics
4. **Accessible**: Respect reduce motion preferences

### Key Animations

- **Camera Capture**: Shutter animation + shrink to gallery (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Edge Detection**: Pulse animation on corners (Duration: 1000ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Success State**: Check mark draw + fade (Duration: 600ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Page Transitions**: Slide + fade (Duration: 250ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens with shimmer (Duration: 1500ms, Easing: linear)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** < 2 seconds on 3G
- **Interaction Response:** < 100ms for touch feedback
- **Animation FPS:** Consistent 60fps

### Design Strategies

- Lazy load images in gallery with progressive loading
- Virtualized lists for large receipt collections
- Skeleton screens during data fetching
- Optimistic UI updates for all user actions
- Image compression with quality previews

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. Create high-fidelity mockups in Figma for key screens
2. Prototype camera capture flow for user testing
3. Develop component library documentation
