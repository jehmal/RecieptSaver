# Project Brief: Receipt Vault Pro

> **NOTE: This document represents the long-term vision for Receipt Vault Pro. At this point, we are primarily focused on getting our front-end done to establish the user experience and interface design.**

## Executive Summary

Receipt Vault Pro is a cross-platform receipt management application designed for small business owners and their employees. The app leverages camera technology to capture, store, and organize receipts digitally, eliminating paper clutter and simplifying expense tracking. Built with React Native, it will deploy to iOS App Store, Google Play Store, and as a progressive web app, providing seamless access across all devices for business expense management.

## Problem Statement

Small business owners and their employees currently struggle with receipt management, leading to:
- Lost receipts resulting in missed tax deductions (average SMB loses $12,000/year in unclaimed expenses)
- Time-consuming manual filing and searching (2-3 hours/week per business)
- Compliance risks during audits due to missing documentation
- Inefficient expense reimbursement processes causing employee frustration
- Physical storage requirements and deteriorating paper receipts

Existing solutions are either too complex for small teams, too expensive, or lack the cross-platform accessibility needed for modern distributed workforces.

## Proposed Solution

Receipt Vault Pro offers a simple, intuitive mobile-first solution that:
- Captures receipts instantly using device cameras with OCR technology
- Automatically extracts and categorizes expense data
- Provides secure cloud storage with instant search capabilities
- Enables easy sharing between business owners and employees
- Works seamlessly across iOS, Android, and web platforms
- Focuses on simplicity over feature bloat - designed for non-technical users

## Target Users

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

- **Camera Capture:** Quick receipt photo capture with auto-crop and enhancement
- **Basic OCR:** Extract date, amount, and merchant name
- **Cloud Storage:** Secure receipt image storage with backup
- **Search:** Find receipts by date, amount, or merchant
- **Multi-platform:** React Native app for iOS/Android + responsive web app
- **User Accounts:** Business owner can create account and invite employees

### Out of Scope for MVP

- Advanced expense reporting and analytics
- Integration with accounting software
- Mileage tracking
- Credit card transaction matching
- Multi-currency support

### MVP Success Criteria

- Successfully capture and store 1,000 receipts across 10 beta users
- 90% OCR accuracy for amount and date fields
- Sub-2 second search results
- Zero data loss incidents

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features

- QuickBooks/Xero integration
- Expense report generation
- Receipt approval workflows
- Mileage tracking with GPS

### Long-term Vision

- AI-powered expense categorization and tax optimization
- Real-time expense analytics dashboard
- Integration with corporate cards
- Multi-business support for accountants

### Expansion Opportunities

- White-label solution for accounting firms
- API for third-party integrations
- International market expansion with multi-currency

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements

- **Target Platforms:** iOS 14+, Android 8+, Modern web browsers
- **Browser/OS Support:** Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge (latest 2 versions)
- **Performance Requirements:** Camera capture < 3s, search results < 2s

### Technology Preferences

- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo managed workflow for faster development)
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express or Firebase Functions
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or Firestore
- **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Google Cloud Platform or AWS

### Architecture Considerations

- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo with shared types/utilities
- **Service Architecture:** Start with modular monolith, microservices-ready
- **Integration Requirements:** OCR service (Google Vision API or Tesseract)
- **Security/Compliance:** SOC 2 Type I compliance roadmap, GDPR-ready

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Budget:** Bootstrap/self-funded initially
- **Timeline:** MVP in 3 months
- **Resources:** 1 developer (you), part-time designer
- **Technical:** Must work offline with sync capability

### Key Assumptions

- Users have smartphones with decent cameras
- Small businesses need simple solutions, not complex ERP systems
- Cloud storage costs will remain manageable with image optimization

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Risk 1:** OCR accuracy on poor quality images could frustrate users
- **Risk 2:** App store approval delays could impact launch timeline
- **Risk 3:** Data privacy concerns might limit adoption

### Open Questions

- What receipt categories are most important for the target users?
- Should we support multiple businesses per account?
- What's the optimal image compression vs quality trade-off?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- Competitor pricing strategies and feature sets
- OCR service comparison for accuracy and cost
- Small business expense management workflows

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. Validate core features with 5 potential users
2. Create PRD with detailed user stories
3. Design initial wireframes for camera capture flow
