# Receipt Vault Pro Product Requirements Document (PRD)

> **IMPORTANT NOTE: This document represents the long-term product vision. At this stage, we are primarily focused on getting the front-end done in React Native to deliver a working web app, iPhone app, and Android app. Backend functionality and advanced features will be addressed in future phases.**

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable small business owners and employees to instantly capture and store receipts using their device cameras
- Eliminate paper receipt management by providing a simple, cross-platform digital solution
- Reduce time spent on expense tracking from hours to minutes per week
- Ensure no business expenses are lost due to missing or damaged receipts
- Provide seamless access across iOS, Android, and web platforms with React Native

### Background Context

Small businesses lose an average of $12,000 annually in unclaimed expenses due to poor receipt management. Current solutions are either too complex for small teams or lack the cross-platform accessibility needed. Receipt Vault Pro addresses this gap with a camera-first, mobile-optimized approach that works seamlessly across all devices. By focusing on simplicity and instant capture, we're solving the core problem of receipt loss at the moment of transaction, when employees are most likely to have the receipt in hand.

### Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS (Must fix before architect can proceed):**
1. **No Epic/Story Structure:** Cannot begin development without work breakdown
2. **Missing Technical Constraints:** No guidance on backend, data storage, or integrations
3. **No Success Metrics:** Cannot validate MVP without measurable goals
4. **Undefined MVP Scope:** No clear boundaries on what's in/out of initial release

**HIGH (Should fix for quality):**
1. **No User Flows:** Camera capture flow, receipt management flow needed
2. **Missing Acceptance Criteria:** Each requirement needs testable criteria
3. **No Data Model:** Receipt data structure and storage approach undefined
4. **Security Requirements Missing:** Authentication, data protection not specified

**MEDIUM (Would improve clarity):**
1. **Incomplete Problem Validation:** Need metrics on $12,000 loss claim
2. **No Competitive Analysis:** How does this differ from existing solutions?
3. **Missing Error States:** What happens when camera fails, storage full, etc?

**LOW (Nice to have):**
1. **Stakeholder section missing**
2. **No glossary for business terms**
3. **Version control for requirements**

### MVP Scope Assessment

**Current State:** The PRD mentions "front-end focus" but doesn't define a true MVP scope.

**Recommendations for MVP:**
- **Core Features Only:**
  - Camera capture with edge detection
  - Local storage of images
  - Basic gallery view
  - Simple search by date
  - Single user account (no roles initially)
  
- **Defer to Post-MVP:**
  - Cloud backup/sync
  - Multi-user with roles
  - Advanced search (merchant, amount)
  - Batch operations
  - Receipt editing

**Complexity Concerns:**
- Edge detection might be complex for MVP
- Offline-first adds significant complexity
- Cross-platform requirements may slow initial delivery

### Technical Readiness

**Current Gaps:**
1. No backend architecture mentioned despite sync requirements
2. Data storage approach undefined (local DB? file system?)
3. No API design for future backend
4. Camera/image processing library decisions missing
5. State management approach for React Native undefined

**Areas Needing Investigation:**
1. Receipt edge detection libraries for React Native
2. Local storage limits on mobile devices
3. Image compression requirements
4. Offline sync conflict resolution
5. Cross-platform camera API differences

### Recommendations

**Immediate Actions (Before Architecture):**

1. **Create Epic Structure**
   - Epic 1: Core Camera Capture
   - Epic 2: Local Receipt Storage
   - Epic 3: Receipt Gallery & Viewing
   - Epic 4: Basic Search
   - Epic 5: User Account (deferred?)

2. **Write User Stories with Acceptance Criteria**
   - Use format: "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
   - Include Given/When/Then acceptance criteria

3. **Define Success Metrics**
   - Example: "50% reduction in receipt capture time"
   - Example: "90% of receipts captured successfully on first attempt"

4. **Clarify Technical Constraints**
   - Minimum image quality requirements
   - Maximum storage per device
   - Sync frequency and conflict resolution
   - Backend technology preferences

5. **Simplify MVP Scope**
   - Consider starting with camera + local storage only
   - Add features incrementally based on user feedback

### Front-End Focus Validation

The PRD correctly emphasizes front-end development with React Native, which aligns with delivering cross-platform apps. However, several front-end specific requirements are missing:

- Component library selection (Native Base, React Native Elements, etc.)
- Navigation approach (React Navigation, Native Navigation)
- State management (Redux, MobX, Context API)
- Testing strategy for React Native components
- Platform-specific UI adaptations

### Final Decision

**STATUS: NEEDS REFINEMENT**

The PRD provides a good vision but lacks the structure and detail needed for development to begin. The most critical gap is the complete absence of Epic/Story breakdown, which prevents any meaningful work planning. Additionally, technical requirements are too vague for architectural decisions.

**Next Steps:**
1. PM should create Epic structure with at least 3-5 stories per Epic
2. Add measurable success criteria
3. Define true MVP scope (consider cutting 50% of current features)
4. Clarify technical constraints and preferences
5. Add user flows for core features

Once these items are addressed, the PRD will be ready for architectural review and development planning.

## Next Steps

### Design Architect Prompt

Create a comprehensive UI/UX specification for Receipt Vault Pro based on this PRD. Focus on:
1. Component hierarchy and design system
2. Screen-by-screen user flows for camera capture and receipt management
3. Cross-platform UI patterns that feel native on iOS, Android, and web
4. Accessibility implementation details
5. Mock data structures for front-end development

Use the UI Design Goals section as your north star, emphasizing the camera-first, one-thumb operation paradigm.

### Architect Prompt

Design the technical architecture for Receipt Vault Pro's front-end focused implementation based on this PRD. Address:
1. React Native project structure with Expo managed workflow
2. State management approach for offline-first functionality
3. Local storage strategy for images and metadata
4. Mock API layer for future backend integration
5. Cross-platform deployment pipeline for iOS, Android, and PWA
6. Performance optimization strategies for image handling

Prioritize getting a working front-end across all platforms with mock data, preparing for future backend integration.
