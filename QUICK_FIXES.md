# Quick Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ Fixed Import/Export Issues
- Updated AppNavigator to use default import for BottomTabNavigator
- Removed circular dependency between components

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Style Warnings (Non-Breaking)
The following warnings can be safely ignored for now:
- Shadow style props deprecated - these are from React Native Paper library
- TextShadow style props deprecated - same as above
- PointerEvents deprecated - from third-party components

These warnings don't affect functionality and will be fixed when the libraries update.
