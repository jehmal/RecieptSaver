### 2. **Gallery Screen Updates**
- Added `useNavigation` hook from React Navigation

  - Grid layout with responsive columns (2-6 based on screen size)
  - Pinch-to-zoom grid resizing
  - Multi-select mode for bulk operations
  - Search and filter functionality
  - Pull-to-refresh
  - Sync status indicators

### 3. **Navigation Flow**

├── Camera
├── Gallery (NEW) ← Grid view of all receipts
└── Search

From Gallery:

```
